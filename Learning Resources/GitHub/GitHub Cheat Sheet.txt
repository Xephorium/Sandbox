/*--- Overview ---*/

GitHub is basically just a fancy code collaboration tool. It allows us to work on the same project from afar
without emailing zip files or exchanging a flash drive.


/*--- First Time Setup ---*/

1. Create an account [Follow Xephorium! :) ]
     https://github.com/
2. Install github (See tutorial below for Windows instructions)
     https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
3. Now, go to our project site!
     https://github.com/Xephorium/Sandbox
4. Copy the repository link (under green code dropdown)
5. Navigate to desired project folder in command line. Enter the following:
     git clone https://github.com/Xephorium/Sandbox
6. The project is now downloaded! From now on, we'll be easily synchronized by command line. A couple basic commands below:
     git pull             -->  Update local project with server changes
     git reset --hard     -->  Disregard local changes & reset to last known server state (might have to do this before pull)

We'll add to this as we go, but this should be enough to get us up and running!


/*--- Commands ---*/

git reset --hard                    // Revert all local changes (Exception: command won't delete new local files)
git checkout "Folder\File"          // Revert changes to specific file
git pull                            // Pull remote commits to local
git add -A                          // Track all local changes for commit
        "Folder"                    // Track specific folder for commit
        "Folder\Subfolder"          // Track specific folder for commit
        "Folder\File.txt"           // Track specific file for commit
git commit -m "Make Changes"        // Commit changes locally with specific message
git commit --amend -m "New Message" // Modify message of last commit (Only works if you haven't pushed yet!)
git log                             // List all project commits ('q' to exit)
git push                            // Push local commits to server
